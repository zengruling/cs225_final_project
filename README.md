**Locations:**
Major code can be found in the main folder of the repository. Data is located in the data folder. To retrieve the data used for the main function, run ./make fetch_data. The only result saved is the graph visualization in the main folder of the repository. 

**Instructions:**
To build and run the main function, run make music, then ./music. Directions on input format are given within the function, but is generally done in the format of indices of the music genre the user wishes to search. Output is to the Linux command line/terminal. 

**Tests:**
Tests and test data are located in the repository's test directory. To build and run tests, run make test and then ./test. Tests ensure the functionality and accuracy of the code base, its functions, objects, and algorithms, sometimes by using a smaller test dataset located within the test directory.
