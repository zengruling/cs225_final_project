>Due to other responsiblities and engagements, as well as a late start in proposal approval, currently the core data structure of our final project is only partly complete. Without this data structure definitively completed, it is difficult to continue work on the algorithms meant to manipulate the data structure. We are hoping to complete the data structure and start work on our algorithms in two days, by November 23rd, Tuesday.

>Today is the last day of our fall break. Besides resting, we also made some progress on our final project. The graph implementation is almost complete, with some little bugs we plan to fix in two days. Currently we are focusing on the traversal and algorithms, and since we lost a whole week on proposal, we will put more effort on those and hopefully we can get them done by next week.

>Today we had a temporary meeting today just before mid-check-point. Up to now, the graph implementation is complete. All tests related to graph function have passed. BSF algortism only left with a few tests. Dijkstra is on half way. Plan to fulfill BSF by today and show it on tomorrows' check-point. Also, plane to fulfill dijkstra function next week. Currently we met github push function problem. Decided to ask advisor the next day.

>Since we fell short of the requirements of the mid-point check-in, we have been doing our best to get our algorithms done soon as possible. Breadth First Search and Djikstra are both in the testing and debugging stages. The drawing functions for the graph visualization are mostly done, there only remains to draw the actual graph (hopefully before Tuesday).

# 12 Dec, 2021
>This week we put much effort to the project and finally we are ending this. We completely finished the functional code-base with all tests and executables on Friday, and we started writing final report and recording presentation video yesterday. Hopefully by the end of today, we will have everything done in the repository.
