# Results/Final Report
**Our final deliverables include:**
- A main function that serves as a rudimentary user interface,
- Functions and objects that:
  - Create (DataReader) and represent (Graph) the graph data structure we used,
  - “Recommends” music genres based on a genre input by the user, listed in order of relevance using Breadth-First Search (BFS, implemented in the central graph structure),
  - Presents the relevance of two genres using Djikstra’s algorithm (Djikstra),
  - Represent the graph visually in the form of an animated gif (GraphDraw, FDGraph (Force-Directed Graph), and FDNode),
- Tests of the above functions, objects, and algorithms done on a smaller dataset to ensure functionality and accuracy,
- Required reports and files in Markdown format (proposal, goals, development log, README, results),
- A final presentation in the form of a short video.
