## Team Contract (hh18-tsha3-rylanmt2-zeng28)
**Communication**
1. **Team Meetings** Team meetings will be twice a week, Tuesday and Sunday, starting at 7PM CST using Zoom.
Notes on decisions outlined within the meeting will be saved on a Google document screenshared during the meeting and edited by all members.
2. **Assistance** The team members creating this contract have all been able to be contacted via Zoom and @illinois.edu email.
Members can be expected to respond within 24 hours.
5. **Respect** Due to a smaller group size, it will be the responsibility of the group as a whole to ensure that each member
has input on significant decisions regarding the final project. Decisions will be set by majority agreement or compromise. 

**Collaboration**
1. **Work Distribution** Weekly goals will be outlined and work will be assigned at Tuesday meetings, 
with Sunday meetings serving as check-ins before weekly progress submission.
Goals will be divided into coding tasks which will be distributed evenly amongst team members or by volunteering.
If a team member forsees a conflict due to other commitments during the week, they should make that known at this time so that work can be distributed accordingly.
Afterwards, said team member may be asked to take on additional work to compensate for missed work during the previous week.
3. **Time Commitment** Team members are expected to spend an average minimum of 2, maximum 6 hours per week on the project.
If one member experiences difficulties completing their share of the work, remaining members should be expected to assist by taking on some additional work. 
4. **Conflict Resolution** Conflicts within the team will be brought up to the involved members and discussed, 
with additional team members present to mediate if necessary.
